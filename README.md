# I2CIOServerArduino

In this project we control a servo by sending I2C commands to an Arduino using the Raspberry Pi. We control the Raspberry Pi from a web interface. The project was made using [CDP Studio](http://cdpstudio.com/home-edition)

This project and the bundled web interface is meant as a simple starting "template" that can be extended further into something more interesting.
